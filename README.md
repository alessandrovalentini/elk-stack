# elk-stack
This project deploy a stack composed by Elasticsearch+Kibana+Logstash plus a demo app connected to elk stack through RabbitMQ. The work is based upon [Piotr MiÅ„kowski project](https://piotrminkowski.wordpress.com/2017/02/03/how-to-ship-logs-with-logstash-elasticsearch-and-rabbitmq/) and improves it adding:
* A deploy using docker-compose instead of multiple docker commands avoiding usage of deprecated --link option replaced by docker network
* An improved logstash configuration wich auto-configures rabbit and logstash without manual actions
* A tutorial to deploy the project on Google Cloud Platform using container-optimized machine


## Google Cloud Configuration
Machine creation and configuration can be found in Google Cloud platform documentation [reference](https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/docker-compose-on-container-optimized-os). This tutorial adds some costumization.

### Machine Setup
1. Open the Google Cloud Platform console.
2. Create a new Compute Engine instance.
3. Select the desired Zone, such as "us-central1-f".
4. Select the desired Machine type, such as "micro" (f1-micro).
5. Change the Boot disk to "Container-Optimized OS stable".
6. Check the box to allow HTTP traffic in the Firewall section.
7. Click the Create button to create the Compute Engine instance.

### Running Docker Compose

Container optimized machine does not provide docker-compose out of the box. To run docker-compose command you need to use a dedicated container 

Create an alias to run this container using `docker-compose` command.
Please note that `/rootfs` has been removed to allow container reasd and write.

```
echo alias docker-compose="'"'docker run --rm \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v "$PWD:/$PWD" \
    -w="/$PWD" \
    docker/compose:1.24.0'"'" >> ~/.bashrc
```
Increase virtual memory limit to start elastic search

```
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

### Network configuration
To expose services on the internet create a firewall rule as follow:
Go to cloud.google.com and select project, then
* Select Networking/VPC network
* Clic "Firewalls rules"
* Clic "Create Firewall Rule"
* Expose ports tcp:5601, tcp:5672, tcp:15672, tcp:8080  to "IP ranges" 0.0.0.0/0
* Create target tags "elk-rabbit"
* Save

Then edit VM instance details and add in "Network tags" section the new tag "elk-rabbit"

### ELK Stack Startup
Clone project directory

```
git clone https://github.com/alessandrovalentini/elk-stack.git
```
Move into directory and run the project
```
cd ~/elk-stack
docker compose up
```
